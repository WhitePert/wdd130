        <h3> I am from a quickly growing town called Queen Creek, Arizona. The temperature difference between Arizona and Rexburg is drastic. Good thing I like being cold.</h3>
        <h3> I am an avid bodybuilder/powerlifter. I would love to build and race my own cars, but as that can get expensive and dangerous quite fast, I sim-race competitvely while I am in the process of building a car over the years.</h3>
        <h3> I own and run my own business. I am looking to grow this business through the knowledge that I gain from my Computer Science Degree.</h3>
